    "#### INTRODUCTION\n",
    "In this project, we will analyze exit surveys conducted by the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. Our goal is to explore patterns and correlations related to employee resignations. By cleaning and combining the exit survey data, we aim to address specific questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Are short-tenured employees resigning due to dissatisfaction compared to longer-tenured ones?\n",
    "Is there a connection between age and employee dissatisfaction?\n",
    "We'll apply data cleaning techniques, handle missing values, and reshape the data for analysis. The project involves comparing exit reasons, employment durations, and age groups to uncover insights into employee turnover and satisfaction."

Subsequently, we used the modified separation types to create new dataframes, dete_resignations and tafe_resignations, containing data only from respondents who indicated a resignation as their reason for separation. The .copy() method was employed to avoid the \"SettingWithCopy Warning,\" ensuring independent and reliable dataframes for further analysis.\n",

This new column effectively condenses the information from the 'Contributing Factors. Dissatisfaction' and 'Contributing Factors. Job Dissatisfaction' columns, providing a more comprehensive perspective on the overall dissatisfaction status of each employee.\n",

    "By consolidating the various contributing factors into a single binary indicator, the 'dissatisfied' column simplifies the process of identifying cases of dissatisfaction. This simplification streamlines subsequent analytical steps and facilitates more focused investigations into the relationships between employee dissatisfaction, demographic variables, and other employment-related factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of True values in the 'dissatisfied' column highlights instances where at least one of the contributing factors was present, indicating potential dissatisfaction. Conversely, False values suggest that the employee did not cite dissatisfaction factors as a reason for resignation. The NaN values denote situations where the contributing factors were not applicable or unavailable, offering transparency regarding data gaps.\n",

    "This streamlined representation opens the door to various analytical opportunities. Researchers and analysts can now easily conduct quantitative assessments to determine the prevalence of dissatisfaction across different employee groups, such as age ranges, gender, employment status, and job roles. Additionally, it allows for exploratory analysis to uncover patterns and correlations between dissatisfaction and other variables, shedding light on potential areas for organizational improvement.\n",

This transparency fosters better communication and informed decision-making regarding employee satisfaction and retention strategies.\n",

    "In conclusion, the addition of the 'dissatisfied' column is a significant step towards creating a more informative and analytically valuable dataset. It enables comprehensive investigations into employee dissatisfaction, empowers data-driven insights, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing resignations within the TAFE institution."

    "\n",
    "#### Cleaning Contributing Factors:\n",
    "Contributing Factors columns were cleaned and transformed to identify dissatisfaction-related factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identification of Dissatisfaction:\n",
    "A new column 'dissatisfied' was created to indicate whether an employee resigned due to some form of dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Institute Identifier Addition:\n",
    "A new 'institute' column was added to both the TAFE and DETE datasets, allowing easy distinction between the two sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combining Datasets:\n",
    "The TAFE and DETE datasets were combined into a single 'combined' dataset, facilitating comprehensive analysis across institutions.\n",

    "In the process of analyzing combined resignation data from **DETE and TAFE** institutes, several key enhancements were made to extract meaningful insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Institute Differentiation:** A new 'institute' column was introduced to differentiate between DETE and TAFE datasets. This contextual information proved crucial when merging the datasets for a holistic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Years of Service Extraction:** The 'institute_service' column was transformed to 'institute_service_up' using the .str.extract() method. This allowed the extraction of numerical years of service from the original range format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experience Categorization:** A function called categorize_experience() was implemented to categorize employees' years of service into distinct groups: \"New,\" \"Experienced,\" \"Established,\" and \"Veteran.\" This categorization provided valuable insights into the distribution of resignations across different experience levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insightful Analysis:** By applying the categorization function, a new column called 'service_cat' was created, indicating each employee's experience group. This categorization enabled a more insightful examination of resignation trends based on employees' tenure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Achievements:** The categorization and grouping of employee experience levels revealed a pattern in resignation distributions. A significant number of resignations were observed in the \"New\" and \"Experienced\" categories, shedding light on potential areas of focus for employee retention strategies. The newly categorized data empowers decision-makers to identify factors influencing resignations and tailor interventions based on specific experience groups.\n",

    "### Result Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Employee Dissatisfaction Based on Years of Service** : In this section, we have analyze the prevalence of employee dissatisfaction based on different categories of years of service. By examining the dissatisfied column in the combined_updated DataFrame, we aim to gain insights into potential trends and patterns that may exist between an employee's years of service and their level of dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Assessment and Data Preparation:**\n",
    "We initiated the analysis by evaluating the distribution of values within the dissatisfied column using the value_counts() function. This allowed us to understand the proportions of True, False, and missing (NaN) values, which are essential for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Missing Data:\n",
    "Before proceeding, we addressed any missing values in the dissatisfied column to ensure accurate results. Missing values were replaced with False using the .fillna() method, contributing to data consistency and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating Dissatisfaction Percentage:\n",
    "To gain a comprehensive perspective on the relationship between years of service and dissatisfaction, we computed the percentage of dissatisfied employees in different categories of service. We created a pivot table named diss_emp that aggregates the data based on the service_cat categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing the Findings:\n",
    "In order to effectively communicate our findings, we utilized a bar chart to visualize the percentage of dissatisfied employees across the various categories of years of service. The resulting chart provides a clear visual representation of any potential patterns or differences in dissatisfaction levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance and Insights:\n",
    "This analysis allows us to uncover insights into the potential correlation between years of service and employee dissatisfaction. By examining the bar chart, we can readily identify whether longer-tenured employees exhibit different levels of dissatisfaction compared to those with shorter tenures. These findings can serve as a basis for deeper investigations and strategic decisions aimed at enhancing employee satisfaction and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our analysis of employee dissatisfaction based on years of service provides an initial understanding of how this factor may influence workplace contentment. The visual representation of data and insights gained serve as a foundation for further exploration and actions geared towards improving overall employee well-being and organizational success.\n",
